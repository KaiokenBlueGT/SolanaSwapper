We appreciate any contributions to this project. This project is driven by a small community and we are happy about all people trying to help, no matter your expertise.

The following are guidelines to help you and get you started.

# Feature requests

You can submit a feature request as an [issue](https://github.com/RatchetModding/Replanetizer/issues). Please include as much information about the feature as possible and note the intended usage.

# Reporting bugs

Before submitting your issue, please check the [list of issues](https://github.com/RatchetModding/Replanetizer/issues) first. Your issue may have already been noticed. Make sure to include as much information as possible. The more information there is, the easier it is to fix the bug.

# Contributing Code

If you want to develop Replanetizer, it is recommended to follow the following steps:

 - Fork this repository
 - Clone the fork
 - Create a new branch in the fork
 - Make your changes
 - Create the pull request

A list of outstanding feature requests and bugs can be found in the [list of issues](https://github.com/RatchetModding/Replanetizer/issues). If you want to work on an unassigned issue, please leave a comment on the issue to let everyone know. This is to avoid the situation where multiple people worked on the same thing without knowing about each other.

If you want to work on something larger, it is recommended to open an issue if there is none already.

There are no rules on commits but we would appreciate informative commit messages and properly separated changes. This means you should avoid making commits called "changes" that contain a large scale feature in just one commit.
